## pixel-spirit-deck

Un-official translation of Patricio Gonzalez's [PixelSpiritDeck](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/PixelSpiritDeck) into cepl/varjo/lisp.


### Why?
To practice lisp, and glsl. To have fun. To have a library of the functions provided there a quickload away.

### TODO
* ~~Shader lisp macro (aka defmacro) to add the boilerplate of each card (st mangling) implicitly.~~
* Have a way to iterate through each fragment.
* ~~Add time~~
